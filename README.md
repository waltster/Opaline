# Opaline

Opaline is a cross-platform app designed to assist you in quitting smoking/vaping for good, combining factual information with gamification. Addiction is not easy to break free from and when in the middle of a withdrawl experience, the most startling facts pale in comparison to the experience of a buzz/high.
